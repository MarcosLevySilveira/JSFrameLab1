InnerWish, the Greek heavy/power metal band, has released their highly anticipated album Ash of Eternal Flame in November 2024, 
marking their return after a long hiatus since their self-titled 2016 album. The album, recorded at LoNe and Devasoundz Studios 
in Athens, brings a heavier, more mature sound that combines power metal's epic choruses with a raw, heavy metal backbone. 
The album includes elements of orchestration, though it maintains a clear focus on the powerful guitar riffs and emotional 
vocals that define InnerWish's style.

A standout feature of the album is the track "Sea of Lies," which features a guest appearance from Hansi Kürsch of Blind Guardian. 
The song touches on the sensitive topic of immigration, told from the perspective of a child facing an uncertain future. The band 
expresses pride in working with Kürsch, as it was a dream come true for them.

The album's overall sound is characterized by a blend of heavy, rock-like riffs and epic choruses that recall the likes of early 
Firewind and Tad Morose, with touches of symphonic influences in places. Fans of power and heavy metal will find Ash of Eternal Flame 
a strong and evocative addition to the genre
